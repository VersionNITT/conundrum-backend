The hobbits were known to live in peace and comfort of home and be away from all things that are deemed dangerous. This hobbit, however, was meant to have an adventure.
    One day, an old wizard came by and asked our hobbit, bilbo to take part in a journey, led by company of Thorin Oakenshield. Bilbo shut the door right there in his face. But in the night, when Bilbo was getting ready for the supper, He heard a sound on the door.
    Whoever that was, knocked on the door in a secret language, find out what he said. We, however, know that this language was used in communication in the old days.

Barrels were kept on a platform, which, after putting a specific combo of barrels, would tilt downwards and load onto a barge.

    Thorin Oakenshield joined the battle and led the dwarves. Legolas, the son of Elf King, rallied the Elves, and Bard, gathered the courage of Men, and all were fighting against the largest army in the middle earth. Dwarves were heavily outnumbered, so Thorin, now their King, decided to take out the head of the snake, and went to the top of hill, where goblin king was commanding his army.
    Goblins were defeated, but at a great cost. Many lives were spent. The Elven king asked Bilbo and company to get the count of exact lives lost of Men, Goblin, Elves, Dwarves and Others. Parchment paper fell short to contain the causalities, so Gandalf suggested a classical Text compression Method, getting the idea from seeing an Old Cedar Tree.
    Bilbo compressed the count and result was a binary string. He took it to the King. Now king needed their exact order, so some would get proper funeral, but bilbo forgot the order. Although He knew that he discovered 3 Men, 5 Goblins, 6 Others, 4 Dwarves and 2 Elves.
